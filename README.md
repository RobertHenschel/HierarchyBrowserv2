# Goal
Visualize an HPC Center and it's resources in a "generic" fashion using objects. Provide **one view** for different data sources and explore what it means to integrate different data sources.

# Concepts
- Hierarchical navigation in a "tree like" structure
- Client/Server architecture
- Server/Provider runs on an HPC login node and browser on a laptop
- Both provider and browser can run on an [HPCDesktop](https://github.com/RobertHenschel/HPCDesktop) 
- Send "objects" via a JSON serialization
- The browser should be as generic as possible
- One provider for each data souirce
- The browser can connect to multiple providers
